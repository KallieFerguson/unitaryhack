`Graphix`¬†is a library to generate, optimize and simulate measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) instruction sets. MBQC is a paradigm of universal quantum computing driven only by (single-qubit) measurements, which is expected to underlie optical quantum information processing and more.

Please see [this page](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix/contribute) for the list of issues we'd like help with during unitaryHack.
