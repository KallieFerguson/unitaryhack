This is a mini-book for a senior undergrad or junior graduate student who is already familiar with the fundamentals of quantum computing, and wants to learn quantum error correction.

For this unitaryHACK, we are looking for both contributions that will eventually make their way into the book, as well as improvements in the website for the book.
