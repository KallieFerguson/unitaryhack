lambeq is an open-source, modular, extensible high-level Python library for experimental Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP), created by [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/)’s QNLP team. At a high level, the library allows the conversion of any sentence to a quantum circuit, based on a given compositional model and certain parameterisation and choices of ansätze, and facilitates training for both quantum and classical NLP experiments.
