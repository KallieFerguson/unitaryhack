HierarQcal is a quantum circuit builder that simplifies circuit design, composition, generation, scaling, and parameter management. It provides an intuitive and dynamic data structure for constructing computation graphs hierarchically. This enables the generation of complex quantum circuit architectures, which is particularly useful for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), where an algorithm can determine the most efficient circuit architecture for a specific task and hardware. HierarQcal also facilitates the creation of hierarchical quantum circuits, such as those resembling tensor tree networks or MERA, with a single line of code. The package is open-source and framework-agnostic, it includes tutorials for Qiskit, PennyLane, and Cirq. Built to address the unique challenges of applying NAS to Quantum Computing, HierarQcal offers a novel approach to explore and optimize quantum circuit architectures.
