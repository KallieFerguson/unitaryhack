Why should you use Symmer? It has been designed for high efficiency when manipulating large Pauli operators - addition, multiplication, Clifford/general rotations, commutativity/contextuality checks, symmetry generating set identification, generator reconstruction and subspace projections have all been reformulated in the symplectic representation and implemented carefully to avoid unnecessary operations and redundancy. Symmer outperforms most contemporary quantum computing packages in these domains and allows us to scale well past 100-qubits, deep into the realm of classical intractability...
