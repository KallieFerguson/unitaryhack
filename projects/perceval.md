Perceval is a python toolkit for:

- composing circuits from linear optical components,
- defining single-photon sources,
- manipulating Fock states,
- running simulations,
- controlling online photonic QPU hardware,
- reproducing published experimental papers and experimenting with a new generation of quantum algorithms.
