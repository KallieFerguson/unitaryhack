The qBraid-SDK is a Python toolkit for cross-framework abstraction, transpilation, and execution of quantum programs. This project, previously available exclusively through the qBraid Lab platform, was released as open-source in May 2023! You could be one of the first contributors to this awesome new package.

Source Code: https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid
Documentation: https://docs.qbraid.com/en/latest/sdk/overview.html
Examples: https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-lab-demo

Key features include:

- Unified quantum frontend interface. Transpiler supports converting quantum circuits between `qiskit`, `cirq`, `braket`, `pyquil`, `pytket` and `qasm` program types.
- Build once, target many. Create quantum programs using your preferred circuit-building package, and execute on any `IBMQ` backend or `Amazon Braket` supported device.
- Benchmark, compare, interpret results. Built-in post-processing functions enable comparing results between runs and across backends.
- Visualization tools including front-end agnostic circuit-drawer

Help us add support for new software frontends, quantum backends, and expand our growing library of quantum tools and developer plugins!
