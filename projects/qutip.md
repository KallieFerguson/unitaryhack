QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems. The QuTiP library depends on the excellent [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [Cython](https://cython.org/) numerical packages. In addition, graphical output is provided by [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of Hamiltonians, including those with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications such as quantum optics, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and quantum nanomechanical resonators.
