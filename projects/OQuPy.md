This project aims to facilitate versatile numerical tools to efficiently compute the dynamics of quantum systems that are possibly strongly coupled to structured environments. It allows to conveniently apply several numerical methods related to the time evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) and the process tensor (PT) approach to open quantum systems. This includes methods to compute ...

- the dynamics of a quantum system strongly coupled to a bosonic environment.
- the process tensor of a quantum system strongly coupled to a bosonic environment.
- optimal control procedures for non-Markovian open quantum systems.
- the dynamics of a strongly coupled bosonic environment.
- the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to multiple non-Markovian environments.
- the dynamics of a chain of non-Markovian open quantum systems.
- the dynamics of an open many-body system with one-to-all light-matter coupling.
