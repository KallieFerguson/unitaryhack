This page details logistics, and sets the rules for unitaryHACK 2023.

## Hacker info

1. unitaryHACK is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned contributor or looking for quantum projects to contribute to for the first time, please **[sign up here]( {{ '/' | url }} )** so we know to look for your contributions! There are some limitations about where we can send bounties, see the [Payment and Swag](#payment-and-swag) section below.
2. A contribution to a participating project for this hackathon consists of making a pull request yourself to the project's repository. For pull requests resolving bountied issues, the first accepted PR from the project maintainers will receive the prize!
3. Hackers can make contributions anytime between May 26th and June 13th [AoE](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth). Quality contributions are encouraged, see some discussion of what makes a good pull request from the [Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards).
4. All participants and maintainers must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct as well as the Unitary Fund's [Community Code of Conduct]({{ '/coc/' | url }}).

## Maintainer info

> What will be expected of me/my team?

In preparation for the hackathon, your project will need to file a series of bountied issues. These can range in difficulty, however they should be well scoped, and provide slightly more background than normal so an external contributor with the right skills can get oriented quickly.

During the hackathon the expectation is that PRs opened by hackers are addressed in a reasonable time frame. Since many hackers are contributing on nights and weekends, giving feedback with ample time to make subsequent changes is very important.

### Maintainer workflow

Logistically, these are the steps a maintainer will take during the hackathon.

1. Hacker opens a PR on your project.
2. Maintainer reviews/requests changes as needed.
3. When PR is merged (or approved), maintainer assigns hacker to the bountied issue so our bots can understand who the bounty should be distributed to. In the cases where the bounty should be split, assign multiple hackers.

> How much activity should we expect to see?

In previous years we've seen some projects garner more attention, and some less. Generally, the more time you've taken to carefully select, scope, and detail issues to be put up for bounty, the more attention you should expect your project to see. Check out last years [results](https://2022.unitaryhack.dev/results/) to get a more detailed sense.

### Payment and Swag

We will do our best to ensure that we can get swag and bounties sent to all who qualify for, but there are some challenges associated with sending money or physical swag packs to countries that have restrictions on shipping or sanctions from the USA. For more info on what countries might be affected, please see the [US Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).
