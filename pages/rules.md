### Payment

We will do our best to ensure that we can get bounties sent to all who qualify, but there are some challenges associated with sending money to countries that have restrictions on shipping or sanctions from the USA. For more info on what countries might be impacted, please see the [US Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).
